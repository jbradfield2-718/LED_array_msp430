LED Array Project
========================

Code to control an 16x32 LED array via the Texas Instruments MSP430G uC.
The included code allows the following two modes which are selectable via pushbutton:

 - Implements Conway's Game of Life algorithm with random seeds.  Game continues
 until pattern begins to repeat, or 60 seconds has elapsed.  New turn every second, game
runs for 60 generations.
 - Manually settable clock which displays time in 12 hour format to the array.
 - If in clock mode, a Game of Life pattern can be generated by asserting pushbutton (see
 port 1 Vector ISR in main_functions.c) which allows a game of Life to be run, then returns to 
 clock.
